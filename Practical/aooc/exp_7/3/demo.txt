In UNIX, the file system is organized in a hierarchical structure.
At the top is the root directory, represented by a forward slash (/).
All files and directories originate from the root and branch out.
UNIX treats everything as a file, including hardware devices and processes.
Each file has permissions that control read, write, and execute access.
Files can be regular files, directories, symbolic links, or special files.
The file system also supports mounting other file systems at any directory.
Efficient file management and security are key features of UNIX systems.
